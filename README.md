# Collection of scripts for extracting data from DFT calculations

This is a selection of scripts for extracting data obtained with different density functional theory (DFT) codes, which I wrote during my time as PhD and PostDoc in the field of computational materials science.

## Requirements

All scripts require at least Python 3 and one or more of the following libraries: numpy, pyscf, pymatgen, ase.
